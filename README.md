How to use

2. Create a NoesisGuiBlueprint from the New>MiscelLaneous menu.

3. Open the blueprint and click on Class Settings in the top bar. Edit the Base Xaml property to refer to the NoesisGuiXaml imported in the first step.

4. Create an instance of the NoesisGuiBlueprint object and call InitInstance on it.
